<p align="center">This project allows sequential playback of music tracks or
navigation through them by clicking buttons. Each music track is
accompanied by a corresponding background image. The goal of the
project is to create an audio player with the ability to play multiple tracks
in order, with options to skip forward or backward between tracks.</p>
